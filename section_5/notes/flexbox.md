# CSS Flexbox
## Basics and Terminology
- > A **flex container** is the box generated by an element with a computed display of flex or inline-flex. In-flow children of a flex container are called **flex items** and are laid out using the flex layout model.

  [Source](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/)

- > The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.
  > (...)
  > Note: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.

### Flex Layout Box Model
![flex layout box model](../assets/flex-direction-terms.svg)
*Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/images/flex-direction-terms.svg*

- The **main axis** of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. It extends in the **main dimension**.
- The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the **cross axis**. It extends in the **cross dimension**.
- The width or height of a flex container or flex item, whichever is in the main dimension, is that box’s **main size**.
- The width or height of a flex container or flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is that box’s **cross size**.
- The flex items are placed within the container starting on the **main-start** side and going toward the **main-end** side.
- [Flex lines](#flex-lines) are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the **cross-start** side of the flex container and going toward the **cross-end** side.

### Flex lines
> Flex items in a flex container are laid out and aligned within flex lines, hypothetical containers used for grouping and alignment by the layout algorithm. A flex container can be either single-line or multi-line, depending on the flex-wrap property (...).

## CSS properties
### Flex container properties
- `display`:
  - > defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value.

    [Source](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

  - values: 
    - `flex`:
      - > The element we've given a   display value of flex to is acting like a block-level element in terms of how it interacts with the rest of the page (...).

        [Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox)
    - `inline-flex`:
      - does not force a new line to begin in the document flow
      - respects `width` and `height` properties values
      - respects `margin` and `padding` and pushes other elements away both horizontally and vertically

- `flex-direction`:
  - > The `flex-direction` property specifies how flex items are placed in the flex container, by setting the direction of the flex container’s main axis.

    [Source](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-direction-property)
  
  - values:
    - `row` (default) - left to right in `ltr`, right to left in `rtl`. See the [note](#css-direction-property) about the `direction` property for more details
    - `row-reverse` 
    - `column`
    - `column-reverse`
- `flex-wrap`:
  - > The flex-wrap property controls whether the flex container is single-line or multi-line, and the direction of the cross-axis, which determines the direction new lines are stacked in.
  
  - values:
    - `nowrap` (default) - the flex container is single-line
    - `wrap` - the flex container is multi-line
    - `wrap-reverse` - the flex container is multi-line; the cross-start and cross-end directions are swapped

     [Source](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#valdef-display-inline-flex)
- `flex-flow`:
  - > The `flex-flow` property is a shorthand for setting the `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` properties, which together define the flex container’s main and cross axes.
    >
    > (...)
    > Note that the `flex-flow` directions are writing mode sensitive. In vertical Japanese, for example, a row flex container lays out its contents from top to bottom (...).

  [Source](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-flow-property)

    Defaults to `row nowrap`.

    See the [note](#css-writing-mode-property) about the `writing-mode` property for more details.

- `justify-content`
- `align-items`
- `align-content`
### Flex items properties
- `order`
- `flex-grow`
- `flex-shrink`
- `flex-basis`
- `flex`
- `align-self`

## Notes
### CSS `direction` property
> The direction CSS property sets the direction of text, table columns, and horizontal overflow. Use `rtl` for languages written from right to left (like Hebrew or Arabic), and `ltr` for those written from left to right (like English and most other languages).
  >
  > (...)
  >
  > Note that text direction is usually defined within a document (e.g., with HTML's `dir` attribute) rather than through direct use of the direction property.

### CSS `writing-mode` property
> This property specifies the block flow direction, which is the direction in which block-level containers are stacked, and the direction in which inline-level content flows within a block container.

  Values:
  - `horizontal-tb`
  - `vertical-rl`
  - `vertical-lr`
  - `sideways-rl` - experimental
  - `sideways-lr` - experimental
